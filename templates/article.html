                                One day my employer decided to send me as a spy to find out the prices of fish 
                                and fish food at a competitive fish shop. I tried to behave like a casual customer 
                                and walked coolly into the competitor’s shop and gradually began to ask the prices of 
                                fish and fish food. After I had found out what was needed I bought a pair of cheap Black 
                                Mollies from his shop just to show him that I was a genuine customer. From the information I 
                                got, we found Ashok’s to be comparatively cheaper than the competitor.

                                <em>During this period I improved my knowledge about aquarium fish tremendously. This was mainly 
                                    due to two things. Firstly, I had spent a lot of time observing the fish at Ashok’s shop and 
                                    getting practical experience from the places we visited.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Secondly, I had been reading the fish books that my father bought for me as a gift for getting 
                                    a distinction in my SSC exam. The books were quite expensive but well worth the cost. Being able 
                                    to get theoretical knowledge and practical experience at the same time gave me a lot of confidence 
                                    with regard to aquarium fish.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the important highlights of my experience at Ashok’s was learning to make fish tanks. Ashok told 
                                me that since we were going through a slack period, he would teach me how to make fish tanks. I had to 
                                start from basics which meant purchasing glass for six tanks, having the glass pieces cut to specifications 
                                and then having the pieces delivered at the shop without a scratch.
